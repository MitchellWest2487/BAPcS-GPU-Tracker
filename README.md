# Reddit GPU Deal Tracker
- Uses Beautifull soup to scrap the sub-reddit buildapcsales for any sales on Asus or EVGA graphics cards.
- Uses apscheduler's blocking scheduler to run the method to check for new deals posted.
- Used win10toast to display a windows notification when a new deal is found containing information about the post.
- Prints any new deals to the command line and the time that the script ran.
